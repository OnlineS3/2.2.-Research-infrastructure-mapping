It will comprise: E-RIHS Headquarters and National Hubs, fixed and mobile national infrastructures of recognized excellence, physically accessible collections/archives and virtually accessible heritage data. Both cultural and natural heritage are addressed: collections, buildings, archaeological sites, digital and intangible heritage. E-RIHS will provide state-of-the art tools and services to cross-disciplinary research communities advancing understanding and preservation of global heritage. It will provide access to a  wide range of cutting-edge scientific infrastructures, methodologies, data and tools, training in the use of these tools, public engagement, access to repositories for standardized data storage, analysis and interpretation. E-RIHS will enable the community to advance heritage science and global access to the distributed infrastructures in a coordinated and streamlined way.', 'Heritage Science has brought about the need of structuring the net of infrastructures operating throughout Europe. Fragmentation, duplication of efforts, isolation of small research groups put at risks the competitive advantage of European heritage science research, promoted so well by the unique cultural heritage. The long?term tradition of this field of research, the ability to combine with innovation, and the integration promoted by EU?funded projects such as EU?ARTECH, CHARISMA and IPERION CH in conservation science, and ARIADNE in archaeology represent the background of E-RIHS. E-RIHS exploits the synergy of the cooperation among the academy, research centers and cultural institutions. The global lead that the EU holds in this research field, so precariously supported by a combination of national and EU measures, requires a joint and resolved effort. This has been fully recognized by the European Union with the continuous and reiterated support of initiatives aimed at integrating existing Heritage Science infrastructures, as well as, with a focus on Member States? national research programs, the JPI on Cultural Heritage, coordinating efforts of 17 EU national funding bodies supporting heritage science. The enthusiastic reviews of these initiatives testify the success of their action to advance knowledge and to establish a research community, acknowledged as ?advanced? in official EU documents concerning conservation, or quickly growing in the field of archaeology as shown by the performance indicators of the relevant project ARIADNE. This demonstrates beyond any doubt both the scientific and the socio?economic importance connected with Heritage Science: it is a sector and a research community that has achieved the maturity necessary to make the leap towards a permanent European Research Infrastructure that will impact broadly on society and economy.', 'E-RIHS is expected to lead a Preparatory Phase in the years 2016-2019 which will be used to address legal status and governance/management organization. This will lead to application to ERIC (or to other suitable legal form). The establishment of a legal structure and governance and the refinement of the business plan for long-term sustainability will be the three most important deliverables, together with demonstrators of users access as implemented by the consortium availing of the existing infrastructure projects. Preliminary work will also be done in the framework of the H2020 IPERION-CH project started in May 2015. E-RIHS will be launched as a stand-alone RI in 2020.

Presently 14 countries are members of the Consortium and one country is a formal observer. Additionally social science data archives from nine other European countries are cooperating, taking part in some way or aiming at membership. In Roadmap since 2006, CESSDA has been listed as success story in Roadmap 2010. Since 2013, CESSDA has been organised as a limited company under Norwegian law.

These Service Providers have a primary responsibility to provide data services to their own country, but they are also explicitly funded to provide pan-European activities. The Service Providers are the main resource for CESSDA, and CESSDA integrates the work of the Service Providers by establishing a one-stop shop for data location, access, analysis and delivery. Each Service Provider has different overall objectives, but in general they each (for their own nation) have a responsibility for acquiring data from data creators (government, researchers, commerce, etc.) and preparing those data for long-term access. Service Providers also carry out a curation function, which means that data is always fit for contemporary use, and are available for discovery and re-use. In essence each Service Provider ensures that data are always available for social science research purposes. CESSDA encourages standardisation of data and metadata, data sharing and knowledge mobility across Europe, streamlining the activities of all the Service Providers, and ensuring equality of data use across boundaries. CESSDA plays an active role in the development of standards and, even more importantly, encourages and facilitates the use of metadata standards for documenting and publishing the existing inventories of research data available from national as well as cross-national data resources in Europe. Put together, the overall ambition is to organise a range of data collections and to coordinate common activities across different national institutions. The institutions will increasingly function as a network in a flexible technical architecture, using standard open protocols and interfaces, designed to contribute to the emerging European and global information commons. The vision for CESSDA is thus to develop a system for data service provision that is open, extensive and evolvable. CESSDA will also attempt to maximises the use of its Service Providers? data holdings while maintaining the rights of subjects and relevant intellectual property rights.', 'CESSDA has already an impact on the social sciences and related research communities. CESSDA Data Catalogue provides a single interface to thousands of unique datasets from social science data archives across Europe, thus widening access to data, permitting European comparative research and proving an input into numerous scientific publications. CESSDA also has an impact on its area of work by providing effective leadership and acting as a catalyst for change across its area of interest ? data curation in its broadest sense ? by allowing transfer of knowledge and tools across the consortium and reducing duplication of certain activities. All CESSDA?s objectives have at their heart the end-user of the data holdings of the various Service Providers. Every objective ensures that the rights of the data subjects and the responsibilities of the data owners are managed appropriately. CESSDA supports Open Data but only in cases where the rights of the subjects and the data controllers are respected.', 'landscape'),

SHARE aims at documenting and better understanding the repercussions of demographic ageing for individuals and the European society as a whole, and forming a sound scientific basis for countermeasures adopted by health and social policy. SHARE?s scientific method is based on a panel design that grasps the dynamic character of the population ageing process in all relevant aspects. Rigorous procedural guidelines and program ensure an ex-ante harmonized cross-national design. The data are harmonised with the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and are accessible free of charge to the scientific community.

With the public release of Wave 5 data in March 2015, the data available to the scientific community are based on more than 220.000 interviews administered on about 110.000 respondents and collected in 21 countries. A comprehensive overview of all available data is given in the SHARE ?data resource profile? which has been authored by the central coordination team and published in 2013 open access by the International Journal of Epidemiology. SHARE is also engaged in several additional data dissemination activities: easySHARE, a simplified dataset for training and teaching purposes, and the Job Episodes Panel, a refined panel dataset spanning the entire working life of SHARELIFE respondents, were both released already in 2013. In 2014, SHARE released an update of the Job Episodes Panel, now including information on migration histories, fertility histories and relationship histories, as well as contextual variables on pension institutions. SHARE has stimulated the publication of about 550 journal articles since the first data release in 2005, or more than 50 per year on average. Trends in publication number are showing that the scientific output is increasing over time. By the end of 2015, SHARE has about 5.100 officially registered data users. Most of the users are from European countries, but there is also an increase in scientific operators from the US and other countries worldwide which may partly be due to the comparability of SHARE data with other international ageing surveys, such as HRS in the US, ELSA in the UK, and others. Most users of SHARE reside in Germany; US is second, before Italy and the Netherlands.', 'Many of the SHARE findings have strong policy implications with large economic and societal impacts. SHARE with its broad data on the economic, social and health situation of European citizens enables Member States to base such difficult economic and social decisions on evidence rather than beliefs. The SHARE data permit an accurate account of who gains and who loses economically from a policy change because the data capture the life circumstances of Europe?s citizens which vary so much not only within, but also between Member States. SHARE has developed innovative software for electronic survey operations, including designing questionnaires, translating them, administering them to respondents, monitoring fieldwork, and creating the databases. In addition, SHARE has innovated the health measurement in large population surveys by introducing physical performance measures ? grip strength, chair stand, peak flow ? and dried blood spot sampling (DBSS) using devices and materials from small/medium-size companies.', 'landscape'),

It maintains Europe at the forefront of the international CCS scientific community making the European Research Area more attractive for European and international scientists and reinforces cooperation between research institutions.', 'Carbon Abatement Technologies (CATs) enable fossil fuels to be used with substantially reduced CO2 emissions. CCS is the most innovative of these technologies by reducing up to 85% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels used for power generation as well as from industrial processes. Global demand is large, in particular from emerging economies. Further research and technological development is urgently needed if CCS is to become a viable and cost-effective technology. It involves the deployment of a chain of technologies for CO2 capture, transportation and storage, rather than developments focused on the combustion plant alone. Most of the technologies needed to implement CCS are currently available through other applications but there is an urgent need to validate the operation of the whole CCS technology chain and to reduce its cost. CCS has the potential to be an essential technology to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and allow the continued use of fossil fuels for energy security, without damaging climate security. Additionally CCS combined with biomass, known as Bio-CCS offers the only large scale means of going carbon negative. Development of new CCS research facilities and upgrades to existing ones have been proposed by ECCSEL, and will require large investments by the parties involved. The facilities being developed will enable more advanced levels of research in CCS. Examples of existing facilities that are initially part of the ECCSEL RI are: High pressure oxy-fuel combustion test rig & Tiller CO2 capture pilot plant & Transport test facility (SINTEF/NTNU, NO); Sotacarbo Research Center - Coal to Hydrogen pilot plant with CO2 capture (Sotacarbo, IT); High pressure absorber and desorber pilot plant (TNO, NL); Hontom?n CO2 Storage Technology Development Plant & Centre for CO2 Capture, Le?n (CIUDEN, ES); Chemical Looping Combustion facility (CERTH, GR); Rock Mechanical & Geophysical Property Testing System & Near surface gas monitoring facility (BGS, UK); High pressure hydrostatic flow cell to measure permeability (ETH-Z, CH); High pressure facility to perform percolation and transfer experiments on fluid-rock interactions (BRGM, FR); PANAREA off-shore & LATERA on-shore CO2 leaking natural laboratories (OGS, IT); Fixed bed reactor for clean coal technologies studies & Pilot-scale moving bed reactor (GIG, PL).', 'ECCSEL was conceived and included in Roadmap 2008.

When Concentrating Solar Technologies are deployed with thermal energy storage, they can provide a dispatchable source of renewable energy. CST technologies use mirrors or lenses to concentrate the sunlight onto a small area. According to the focusing principle, there are two main concentration mechanisms: line focus and point focus. Line focus principle is represented mainly by the Parabolic Trough and the Linear Fresnel, whereas point focus principle by the Central Receiver and the Parabolic Dish. The different types of concentration mechanisms produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies, due to the differences in the way that they track the sun and focus the light. Therefore, each technology is used for specific applications in a variety of fields: Power, Steam, Cooling, Desalination and Thermochemical plants. EU-SOLARIS is aiming at creating a new legal entity to explore and implement new and improved rules and procedures for Research Infrastructures (RIs) for Concentrating Solar Thermal and Solar Chemistry technologies, in order to optimise RI development and Research and Technology Development (RTD) coordination.

Also the Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee (NuPECC), whose aim is to promote collaborative ventures between nuclear physicists within Europe, has selected ISOL@ MYRRHA to be part of its long-range plan of the top facilities for nuclear physics in Europe. MYRRHA is designed as a flexible fast spectrum irradiation facility. This means that a fast neutron spectrum is present at every location in the reactor and that every fuel assembly position can be loaded with a driver MOX fuel assembly, a minor actinides fuel experimental assembly, a dedicated experimental rig for material irradiation or Radioisotopes production rig. In this way, the entire reactor volume offers possibilities of loading experimental fuel assemblies in conditions similar to the reactor conditions, being a fast neutron spectrum, and in contact with the flowing liquid lead-bismuth at reactor operating temperatures. MYRRHA will be able to host at least 8 in-pile sections (IPS) (representing a total volume of 8 x 3.700 cm3) with a core-loading pattern optimised to obtain the most appropriate irradiation conditions in the IPS. In this double-walled IPS, a different coolant (Na, NaK, He, H2O) can be present with temperature and pressure conditions optimised for the experimental fuel/material loaded in the IPS.

As well as being deployed onshore, the infrastructure can be operated offshore from stable and floating platforms or by doing measurement of near-coastal wind farms. WindScanners provides unique services for the scientific community and wind industry, a one-point of entry and a joint access programme, joint R&D development activities, joint training and educational programme, stable and effective management and a strategic approach for planning and implementing measurement campaigns in Europe.', 'Wind energy is about to become the leading electricity generating technology across Europe. In 2015, 43% of the electricity produced in Denmark came from wind energy. However, a massive increase in installed wind power capacity throughout Europe is still required to meet the political goals for this sustainable energy system. The energy system of the future must provide secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy, while at the same time creating new jobs and growth. Significant progress in lowering cost of energy (LCoE) has already been achieved, but there is still potential for cost reductions, through market development, research and innovation, for wind energy to reach its full potential. WindScanner is conceived as a new unique European distributed, mobile research infrastructure to provide the experimental data needed by the European wind energy?s research community for high-quality fullscale atmospheric measurements of the wind fields surroundings today?s huge wind turbines, wind farms, bridges, buildings, forests and mountains. The European WindScanner facility uses remote sensed wind measurements from space and time synchronized scanners to provide detailed wind field maps of the wind and turbulence conditions from the individual turbine scale to entire wind farms extending several kilometres. Via excessive data analysis WindScanner provides detailed inflow and wake measurements for validation and verification of wind turbine design and siting and for future optimisation of design making wind energy become cheaper and more reliable for the benefit of the society. WindScanners generate very detailed and huge amounts of data, which are challenging for researchers and other users to analyse and interpret. Therefore, in the forthcoming years, the WindScanner data acquisition and post processing needs to become faster accessible to users and the scanned 3D wind velocity data interpretation less complex. The WindScanner infrastructure has its primary use within the fields of measurements around large wind turbines, on and off shore. However, it also serves other purposes such as atmospheric boundary layer research, air safety, wind loads on buildings and bridges, wind circulation in streets and the urban environment in general.', 'WindScanner was included in the Roadmap in 2010 as a European joint effort to coordinate a network between distributed WindScanner systems and demonstration nodes embedded within leading European organizations for wind energy research.

Once fully established, the WindScanner Facility is expected to consist of 6-8 National Nodes throughout Europe, each node having its own portable rapid deployable short and/or long-range WindScanner System. The mobile distributed research infrastructure will be led from a WindScanner Central Hub (WCH) located in Denmark, hosted by DTU.

Its primary uses will be research into the performance of nuclear fuel at existing reactors, testing of materials used in reactors, testing designs for fuel for future reactors and the production of radioisotopes for use in medicine. The site preparation for the project began at the Cadarache Research Centre in 2007. The first concrete step for the reactor?s foundations was poured in 2009, and the central containment structure was completed with the addition of a 105-tonne dome in late 2013. The Jules Horowitz Reactor will be built and operated in the framework of an international cooperation between several organizations bound by a Consortium Agreement signed on March 2007 by partners from 9 countries. The Jules Horowitz Reactor is expected to be in operation by the end of this decade.', 'Available for ESFRI projects only', 'Available for ESFRI projects only', 'The JHR is an experimental reactor facility. It is not intended to generate electrical power, but to provide scientific data concerning nuclear fuel and material behaviour under exposure to very high stresses (high neutron fluxes). The nuclear unit is composed of only one civil engineering structure supporting two zones with different containments: the Reactor Building (RB) and the Nuclear Auxiliary Building (NAB). The objective of this single structure is to contain all the radioactive materials in one place. The reactor is a pool type reactor with a maximum power output of approximately 100 megawatts. This power is dissipated via the primary and the secondary circuit to the external cold source during irradiation; the core, the primary circuit and experimental rigs, are completely enclosed in the RB. The Fission Product Laboratory will be settled in this area to be connected to several fuel loops either for low activity gas measurements (HTR) or high activity gas measurements (LWR rod plenum) or water measurements (LWR coolant) with gaseous chromatography and mass spectrometry. The reactor pool is connected to several storage pool and hot cells located in the NAB through a water block. The experimental process will make use of two hot cells to manage experimental devices before and after the irradiation. Safety experiments are an important objective for JHR and require an ?alpha cell? to manage devices with failed experimental fuel. A fourth hot cell will be dedicated to the transit of radioisotope for medical application and to the dry evacuation of used fuel. Three storage pools are dedicated respectively to spent fuel, experimental devices and mechanical components management. JHR has a planned service lifespan of around 50 years, and is designed to be adaptable for a variety of research uses by nuclear utilities, nuclear steam system suppliers, nuclear fuel manufacturers, research organisations and safety authorities. The reactor?s versatile modular design allows it to accommodate up to 20 simultaneous experiments.

CTA will provide the first complete and detailed view of the universe in this part of the radiation spectrum and will contribute towards a better understanding of astrophysical and cosmological processes, such as the origin of cosmic rays and their role in the Universe, the nature and variety of particle acceleration around black holes and the ultimate composition of matter and physics beyond the Standard Model.', 'High-energy gamma-rays probe a non-thermal Universe because, apart from the Big Bang, there is nothing hot enough in the known Universe to emit such gamma-rays. These gamma-rays can be generated when highly relativistic particles collide with ambient gas, or interact with photons and magnetic fields (bottom-up process). By studying their energy and flux spectrum, it is possible to trace these cosmic rays and electrons in distant regions of our own Galaxy or even in other galaxies. High-energy gamma-rays can also be produced in a top-down fashion by decays of heavy particles such as the hypothetical dark matter particles. Therefore, gamma-rays provide a window to the discovery of the nature and constituents of dark matter, relics which might be left over from the Big Bang. The present generation of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS) has in recent years opened the realm of ground-based gamma ray astronomy in the energy range above a few tens of GeV. The Cherenkov Telescope Array will explore our Universe in depth in Very High Energy (VHE, E>10 GeV) gamma-rays and investigate cosmic non-thermal processes, in close cooperation with observatories operating at other wavelength ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, and those using other messengers such as cosmic rays and neutrinos. The CTA Research Infrastructure will consist of arrays of Cherenkov telescopes that will be built at two separate sites, one in the southern hemisphere with wide gammaray energy range and high resolution to cover the plane of the Milky Way, and the second in the northern hemisphere specialised for lower energies, which will focus on extragalactic and cosmological objects. The array will allow the detection of gamma-ray induced cascades over a large area on the ground, increasing the number of detected gamma rays dramatically, while at the same time providing a much larger number of views of each cascade. The design foresees an improvement in sensitivity of a factor of 5-10 in the current very high-energy gamma ray domain from ? 100 GeV to some 10 TeV ? and an extension of more than three orders of magnitude in the accessible energy range, up to above 100 TeV', 'CTA is included in the ESFRI Roadmap since 2008 and it is a priority for scientific communities in astronomy at an international level.

One aim is to address the still unresolved and difficult question concerning the emergence of magnetic fields at the solar surface and transfer of magnetic and kinetic energy from subsurface layers to the solar atmosphere. This is the key question for understanding how the magnetic field is controlling the solar atmosphere and its activity. As the Sun is the only star at which photospheric and chromospheric features can be resolved, these observations will be of astrophysical wide relevance. Understanding the interaction of plasmas with magnetic fields has many technological application, e.g. in fusion nuclear reactors. Space missions are also tributary of data from ground solar telescopes.', 'The solar physics community was involved in the development of the project from the beginning: i) creation of the EAST consortium, ii) elaboration of the conceptual design study, iii) I3 Trans-National Access network SOLARNET and iv) GREST project. The solar astronomy community is organized through SOLARNET and ASTRONET and operates with success, since the last decades, a set of national observing facilities and infrastructures on the Canary Islands including the Swedish Solar Telescope, the DOT, the VTT, GREGOR and THEMIS, most of which are approaching the end-of life stage. These national observatories shall be decommissioned or reoriented to become test facilities for detector development or to educational programmes, and the research programme shall concentrate to the EST.

DKIST is an asymmetric telescope with an observation programme concentrated on the Sun?s corona and linked with space missions. EST has the same diameter (4m) but it is symmetric and optimized to detect light polarization as it is mandatory for the study of the emergence of magnetic fields at the solar surface and transfer of magnetic and kinetic energy from subsurface layers to the solar atmosphere. A significant advance can be achieved by obtaining observations, of the lower/cooler part of the solar atmosphere, with greatly improved spatial and temporal resolutions. The behaviour of the solar atmosphere in response to the input of magnetic energy is then observable with space instrumentation. The combination of space and ground-based instrumentation will allow a throughout comprehension of the solar magnetic dynamics.', 'EST will be built in the Canary Islands, where the current aging telescopes are already situated.

Their measurement will allow for new insights into the mechanisms and processes that govern the non?thermal Universe and will complement high?energy gamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray studies. Neutrinos are extremely light particles and electrically neutral thus travelling in straight lines from their origin to the Earth. They interact weakly and thus can escape dense regions where they are generated. They are inevitably produced in any environment containing protons or nuclei at the typical energies observed in cosmic rays. Neutrinos are ideal for observing the highest?energy phenomena in the Universe and, in particular, pinpointing the hitherto unknown sources of cosmic rays. The IceCube neutrino telescope at the South Pole has detected a flux of cosmic neutrinos which is assumed to have its origin in extragalactic sources. They might be the same sources that produce the flux of the highest energy gamma rays observed, for instance, by H.E.S.S.. The high-energy neutrino part of KM3NeT 2.0 (ARCA) will detect the neutrino flux reported by IceCube and will provide essential data concerning its origin, energy spectrum and flavour composition.

ECRIN works with colleagues worldwide to promote implementation of recommendations for integrated clinical trial governance.', 'ECRIN clinical trials may have multiple social and economic impacts. Clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of new products result in health innovation, with a strong positive impact on the health industry (medicines, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics) and nutrition sectors. They also have a positive impact on citizens? health, although they frequently increase the economic burden of healthcare. Clinical trials exploring new indications for already authorized products (repurposing trials) have an impact on citizens? health, and also enlarge the health industry market. Clinical trials comparing authorized treatments (comparative effectiveness trials) result in an improvement in healthcare strategies (with a measurable economic impact on wellbeing and productivity), and in healthcare cost containment. ECRIN is a major tool to address the health grand challenge. Clinical trials are essential tools for the development of health innovation and treatment repurposing.

The realisation of ESS enables access to frontier technology, experienced technical and scientific staff as well as unique production facilities and technologies, which would otherwise be unattainable. In addition, the ESS will be a key instrument for addressing the Grand Challenges through novel insights on matter at the molecular and atomic level and applications to energy, carbon sequestration methods, health issues at biology level as well as drug development and delivery strategies, plant water-uptake processes of relevance for agriculture, novel data storage materials, and more.', 'landscape'),

Initially, 3 photon beamlines and 6 instruments will be built. Eventually, 5 photon beamlines and 10 experimental stations will enable experiments ranging from coherent diffraction imaging to spectroscopy and exploit the high intensity, coherence, and time structure of the new source. Some expected scientific benefits will consist in studying molecular configuration rearrangements during chemical reactions down to the sub-picosecond (ps) scale, observing the dynamics of fluctuations on unprecedented time and length scales, providing experimental access to regions of the phase diagram of materials currently found only in astrophysical environments.

The radar system is designed to investigate how the Earth?s atmosphere is coupled to space but it will also be suitable for a wide range of other scientific targets including climate change, space weather, plasma physics, space debris and near-Earth object studies.', 'The incoherent scatter radar technique is one of the most powerful methods for detailed measurements of the conditions in the ionosphere, the uppermost and partially ionised part of the atmosphere. Similar to the case of standard radar techniques, the incoherent scatter radar technique involves transmission of a radio signal in the direction of a target, and detection and analysis of the signal returning back. The main difference is that with the incoherent scatter radar technique the target is the electrons in the ionosphere in a volume filling the full radar beam. The returned signal from the electrons is very weak, requiring a powerful radiowave emission and efficient detectors in order to receive a good return signal/noise. The typical set of parameters obtained from an incoherent scatter radar measurement includes the electron density, the electron and ion temperatures, and the bulk plasma velocity along the direction of the radar beam: their time and the distance dependence from the receiver are recorded. By using three or more geographically separated receivers looking at the same volume of the ionosphere it is also possible to determine the full three-dimensional bulk plasma flow velocity within that common volume. Thus, a system using the incoherent scatter radar technique can be seen as a weather station making detailed observations of the state of the ionosphere above the radar system. The EISCAT_3D system will consist of five phased-array antenna fields each with around 10.000 crossed dipole antenna elements. The core site will transmit radio waves at 233 MHz, and all five sites will have sensitive receivers to measure the returned radio signals. Digital control of the transmission and low-level digitisation of the received signal will permit instantaneous electronic steering of the transmitted beam and measurements using multiple simultaneous beams. The central antenna array at each site will be surrounded by smaller outlying arrays which will facilitate aperture synthesis imaging to acquire sub-beam transverse spatial resolution. The central array of each site will be of a size of about 70 m from side to side, and the sites will be located from 90 km to 250 km from the core site in order to be able to maximise the coverage by the system.', 'EISCAT_3D will be an integral part of EISCAT Scientific Association which has successfully managed incoherent scatter radars on the mainland and on Svalbard for more than thirty years. The present EISCAT systems are fully integrated in the global network of incoherent scatter radars. A staged approach to the construction and commissioning of the EISCAT_3D system was prepared: in the first stage the core site will be built near Skibotn in Norway and the first two receiver sites will be built in areas near Bergfors in Sweden and Karesuvanto in Finland. For the later stages of the construction, areas on And?ya (Norway) and near Jokkmokk (Sweden) were identified as locations for receiver sites. Full operation of the EISCAT_3D configuration is expected in 2021.', 'Available for ESFRI Landscapes only', 'Available for ESFRI Landscapes only', 'project'),

SIOS will link with other observational infrastructures across the Arctic to share data and best practice, contributing to a pan-Arctic observational structure that facilitates better regional modelling and understanding of the role of the Arctic in the Earth System.', 'Environmental change is one of the most important challenges facing humankind and nature today. Global climate models demonstrate that polar regions play a crucial role in the Earth?s climate system. The Arctic region will probably experience the most severe climate change worldwide with an anticipated warming of four to eight degrees (annual average) and a significant increase in precipitation until the end of the 21st century. Svalbard is consequently an important arena for investigations of environmental and climate change. Additionally, it is acknowledged a need for a better overview of Svalbard as a research platform, and a political need for better research infrastructure coordination. Understanding the local, regional and global implications of Arctic environmental and climate change requires state-of-the-art research services and coordinated observations. Located in a region of the Arctic where the physical, biological and chemical exchange processes are particularly dynamic and relevant for a systems understanding, the systematic collective efforts facilitated by SIOS will permit solving globally relevant ESS questions. SIOS will prioritize measurements of variables whose interactions are believed to be significant in Svalbard (e.g. ocean-atmosphere, ocean-biology, atmosphere- biology). In particular, the coordinated core observation program, guided by a joint strategy and development plan, will provide measurements that are assumed able to elucidate important processes acting on annual to decadal time-scales, allowing detection, attribution and understanding climate changes and consequences. SIOS, through the Knowledge Centre (KC), will provide expertise and services aiming at securing the core programme, building capacity and enabling research of relevance to the Earth System Science. The SIOS-KC will build capacity by stimulating regular development of the core program and new observational techniques that are clean, energy efficient and robust in the Arctic environment.

EURO-ARGO contributes to the establishment of the ARGO global array ? almost 4.000 drifting profiling floats worldwide ? for in-situ measurements integrated with other elements of the climate observing system, in particular satellite observations, to detect climate variability from seasonal to decadal scales and provide long-term observations of climate change in the oceans. This includes regional and global changes in temperature and ocean heat content, salinity and freshwater content, sea level and large-scale ocean circulation. In addition, EURO-ARGO provides data to constrain global and regional ocean analysis and forecasting models, delivers information to initialize seasonal and decadal forecasting ocean/atmosphere-coupled models and produce the evidences necessary for calibration and validation of satellite data. Contributions to the global array are progressing and European partners continue to be major actors in the ARGO data management system to target research (climate and oceanography) and operational oceanography communities and to prepare and start implementing the next phase of ARGO.

This input is essential for climate research, emissions monitoring, weather prediction and air quality forecasting. Data is provided for climate models, including those used by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, and for the carbon cycle models employed for the verification of CO2 emission and Kyoto monitoring. Regional air quality models will assimilate IAGOS near real-time data to improve forecasts. IAGOS data are also utilised for the calibration and validation of satellite sensors.

The investments and running costs needed for a global GHG monitoring and analysis network are marginal compared to these costs and could be easily compensated due to improved effectiveness of the mitigation strategies. Additional benefit will come from detecting and pointing to surprise changes in the earth system and from detecting non-compliance of regions, sectors or countries with the agreed objectives. Furthermore, ICOS GHG observations and outreach activities, have already increased the public awareness and stimulated changes towards green economy and decarbonisation of agricultural, industrial and transport processes. A substantial impact comes also from the harmonization and standardization of measurements and data formats including improved QA/QC standards and data protocols.

It will provide the framework to significantly enhance interactions between science and industry, notably in the key domains of resource management and conservation, aquaculture and blue biotechnology. It will offer access to the infrastructure sites, on-site or remote access to biological resources and analytical services as well as virtual access to data. It will help to coordinate the negotiation of Material Transfer Agreements and host and collaborative agreements, in order to avoid restrictions in accessing the RI.', 'EMBRC has completed a Preparatory Phase from February 2011 to February 2014, which was funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme for Research Infrastructures. During the Preparatory Phase, EMBRC has developed a blueprint of the infrastructure including a plan for EMBRC activities and services, governance structure and business plan. Until mid 2016, EMBRC aims at establishing a legal structure in the form of a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). It will also be an important period for building the EMBRC headquarters, for initiating and intensifying international collaborations, and for developing the EMBRC services. EMBRC will be operational from mid 2016. However, some services will be available to the user community before this date, such as the European Marine Training Portal.', 'Available for ESFRI Landscapes only', 'Available for ESFRI Landscapes only', 'project');

EMPHASIS will establish an integrated European phenotyping infrastructure to analyse genotype performance under diverse environmental conditions and quantify the diversity of traits contributing to performance in diverse environmental scenario ? plant architecture, major physiological functions and output, yield components and quality. EMPHASIS aims to address the technological and organizational limits of European Phenotyping, for a full exploitation of genetic and genomic resources available for crop improvement in changing climate.', 'Sustainable intensification of crop production is a major challenge to ensure amount and quality of biomass for nutrition and industry. Designing high yielding crop varieties adapted to contrasting environmental conditions, climate change and management, is a priority. Technological advancements have boosted the characterisation of genomes, without sufficient development in phenotypic characterisation. The mission of EMPHASIS addresses an important bottleneck in sustainable and improved crop production in different, current and future, agro-climatic scenarios: how to translate from high-throughput genotypic analysis of crop variants to high-throughput and high-resolution phenotyping in order to identify high-yield crop varieties for defined environmental conditions. To achieve this, EMPHASIS proposes a major upgrade/reorientation of existing European Research Infrastructure by linking and developing national initiatives, amongst which are national platforms with (semi)-controlled conditions for high-resolution phenotyping and high-throughput phenomics, experimental fields with control of rainfall and CO2 highly-equipped with phenotyping devices, a coordinated network of field experiments in distributed sites with lighter but efficient phenotyping close to practical breeding set-ups and modelling platforms to test existing and virtual combinations of alleles in different climates and management practices. Some methods used will include sensors and imaging in plant architecture and dynamics, consistent distributed information system, and statistics and dynamic modelling. EMPHASIS can test genotypes in current and future agro-climatic scenarios and provide community access to controlled and field conditions; link data acquisition to a European data management and to crop models simulating performance in current and future climates; develop, evaluate and disseminate novel technologies and provide new opportunities to European companies and make infrastructures and concepts accessible to academia and industry in Europe.', 'Political support and commitment to EMPHASIS has been expressed by 4 European countries ? Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom ? in the form of previous investments and an additional investment (Germany).

Currently (until the end of 2015) limited access to national phenotyping facilities in Germany, France, UK, Denmark, Netherlands, Hungary and Czech Republic, is supported by an I3 EPPN project, the European Plant Phenotyping Network (finishing end of 2015). EMPHASIS is already placing Europe in a leading position via the International Plant Phenotyping Network IPPN, and has already engaged further Member States in their current plans.

ERINHA seeks to reinforce the European capacities for the study of Risk Group 4 pathogens, enhance the coordination of Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) activities and give access to BSL-4 facilities to all interested European scientists by establishing a pan- European distributed RI. ERINHA encompasses basic research into pathogen isolation/characterisation, the pathogenesis of human diseases caused by dangerous microrganisms. It enables translational research to develop new counter measures including diagnostics, therapeutics and prophylactics and applied research to improve knowledge, skills and the evidence-base around high containment working practices.', 'One of the great challenges of the 21st century is the capability to react on human and animal highly pathogenic micro-organisms which are characterised by a high mortality rate induction, unavailability of prophylactic or therapeutic means and easy human-tohuman transmission. All infectious micro-organisms are classified by risk group according to the pathogenicity, modes of transmission and host range of the organism. The most highly infectious pathogens are classified as risk group 4. To protect environment from spread and to protect scientists from infection, these micro-organisms must be handled and stored in Biosafety Level 4 facilities. The current epidemic context ? outbreak of Ebola, Nipah and SARS ? have demonstrated the reality of dangerous infectious threats and the worldwide vulnerability towards emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and has highlighted the need for such an infrastructure to prevent and respond to the spread of epidemics more effectively and efficiently. A European coordinated strategy is needed to ensure preventing each European citizen from pandemics or bioterrorist attack involving suspected group 4 pathogens. It implies the construction and implementation of a pan-European high security BSL-4 research infrastructure. ERINHA is the sole European research infrastructure specifically dedicated to BSL-4 capacities. It is a unique and innovative infrastructure that intends to bring Europe to the forefront of research on highly virulent agents and offer European expertise to overcome and prevent the spread of epidemics. ERINHA contributes to the H2020 societal challenge ?Secure societies ? protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens? and ?Health, Demographic Change and Wellbeing?.', 'ERINHA is included in the ESFRI Roadmap since 2008 and is currently in its Preparatory Phase (I and II), which runs from November 2010 to June 2017 during which founding members of the RI will agree on the legal status, host country for the Central Coordination Unit, operational procedures and funding. ERINHA will be organised through a Central Coordination Unit headed by a Director General and based on capacities provided by all founders of the infrastructure. A Central Coordinating Unit will be headed by a Director General acting as CEO of ERINHA under the mandate given by the RI steering committee. National nodes will link the relevant national activities with the activities of ERINHA. A scientific advisory board and an ethics advisory board will advise the steering committee in evaluating the research programmes submitted to ERINHA. Financial and business plans are under implementation in the framework of the Preparatory Phase II.

EU-OPENSCREEN enables scientists to use compound screening methods to validate novel therapeutic targets and also support basic mechanistic studies addressing fundamental questions in cellular physiology (across human, animal and plant systems) using the methods of chemical biology. As a large-scale RI with an ?open? pre-competitive character, EU-OPENSCREEN is a cost-effective solution to the need of the broad scientific community providing access to Europe?s leading screening platforms and chemistry groups, constructing a jointly used compound collection and operating an open-access database accessible on a global basis. The European Chemical Biology Database (ECBD, https://www.eu-openscreen-data.eu/) serves as a collaborative data-sharing environment among partner sites and their users.', 'Understanding how biological processes operate and how the underlying mechanisms function at the organismic, cellular, and molecular level is fundamental to a knowledge-based management of the needs and risks of the world?s growing population. This understanding touches all aspects of life such as human health and well-being, nutrition and environment. Ground-breaking insights into cellular and organismic metabolic or signalling pathways, which are involved, for example, in the progression of diseases, are gained by studying the effect of chemical compounds on biological systems (i.e. pharmacology). This forms the basis for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in health research and opens novel opportunities in many other areas of the Life Sciences. EU-OPENSCREEN integrates high-capacity screening platforms throughout Europe, which jointly use a rationally selected compound collection, comprising up to 200.000 commercial and proprietary compounds collected from European chemists. By testing systematically and repeatedly this chemical collection in hundreds of assays originating from very different biological themes, the screening process generates enormous amounts of information about the biological activities of the substances and thereby steadily enriches our understanding of how and where they act. EU-OPENSCREEN supports all stages of a tool development project, including assay adaptation, highthroughput screening, and chemical optimisation of the hit compounds. All tool compounds and data are made available to the scientific community. The broad biology approach of EU-OPENSCREEN will promote the availability of safe, efficacious and sustainable chemical products for unmet needs in medicine, nutrition, agriculture and the environment. Academic stakeholders, providing the physical screening infrastructure, are joined by industrial stakeholder companies (large, medium and small) of the Pharmaceutical, Agri-Science and Biotechnology sectors. By doing so, EU-OPENSCREEN will advance the development of solutions for the Grand Challenges and guarantee the European competitiveness.', 'EU-OPENSCREEN is included in the ESFRI Roadmap since 2008. It adopts a distributed network of several partner sites with a broad collaborative scope. It successfully initiated the formation of national chemical biology networks among the 16 partners of its Preparatory Phase that each nominated a national node institute. Thus, future partner sites are already operational now within national networks and offer screening services to local and external researchers. A centralised coordination of local activities is required for the individual partner sites to operate with common standards, joint training programs, and shared use of a common compound collection and database.

The EuBI will consist of a set of complementary, strongly interlinked and geographically distributed Nodes ? specialised imaging facilities ? to reach European scientists in all Member States. The infrastructure will be empowered by a strong supporting and coordinating entity, the EuBI Hub. The Hub will provide the virtual access entry point from which users will be directed to their desired imaging technology as served by the respective EuBI Nodes. Within the Hub, dedicated data management and training activities tailored to the needs of users of the imaging infrastructure will be coordinated.', 'Advanced and innovative imaging technologies are becoming increasingly important for analysis of molecular dynamics in cells and organisms, delivering certain information easier than standard biochemical methods. Nevertheless, European life scientists lack access to innovative imaging technologies. Euro- BioImaging believes that this gap could be reduced by creating a distributed imaging infrastructure offering open access to external users from other European institutions. Such open access model will not only bring scientific benefits. It could mitigate the high costs of innovative imaging technologies and the scarcity of expert staff, increase international cooperation and boost transfer of knowledge among European researchers. EuBI will allow life scientists working in academia, health care and industry to gain access to a broader range of much-needed advanced imaging technologies and knowledge, building bridges from basic biological to medical and clinical research as well as interdisciplinary research. It will provide: i) physical access to cutting-edge imaging technologies ? including advanced probes, expertise and training, methods, software and analysis tools ? at the Nodes, and ii) virtual access to common image data services provided by the Hub ? software tools for image processing, common repositories for reference image data sets for sharing and re-use, academically owned cloud storage and compute services.

During the Preparatory Phase, ISBE successfully implemented a European Systems Biology Community website (http://community.isbe.eu) which provides a public interface to a community database and easy access to information about researchers and institutions in the field of systems biology.', 'ISBE ended its Preparatory Phase in autumn 2015, coordinated by Imperial College London with support from a Steering Committee made of the work package leaders, and with independent advice from a Scientific Advisory Board. During the construction phase, from 2016 onwards, a core network of ISBE centres will be put in place, initially, and made operational. This network will then be expanded to provide a fully operational comprehensive infrastructure with ISBE centres located throughout Europe and coordinated through the Central ISBE Office (CIO). ISBE will start the delivery of a portfolio of web-based services and resources, including: i) modelling services to aid biologists incorporate computational modelling into their research; ii) access to tools, standards and model compliant data and maps through the existing FAIRDOM initiative, a joint action of ERASysAPP with ISBE; iii) education and training via dissemination and training courses in systems biology, in collaboration with ERASysApp; iv) liaison with scientific journals, including developing and disseminating community standards and standard operation procedures in the systems biology.

MIRRI, a coordinated approach to mBRC activity, will foster European research and innovation in the academic and bio-industrial areas by improving access to high quality authentic microbial resources and their associated data in a legally compliant framework with the objective to alleviate the current fragmentation of bioresource holdings and information, and eliminate duplication and redundancy at the national and pan-European level.', 'Microbial resources have been recognised as essential raw materials for the advancement of health and for biotechnology, agriculture, food technology and research in the life sciences. To date, less than 1% of the estimated number of species are described and available to be harnessed by man and less than 0,1% of prokaryote strains published in the scientific literature were deposited in public service collections or mBRCs or simply retained for future study and use. About 0,5 million strains are supplied each year by collections registered with the World Data Centre for Microorganisms (WDCM). It is estimated that 70% of strains used in published research are not coming from collections, thus tens of thousands resource strains are sourced for research often without proper authentication and provenance. MIRRI will provide a wealth of additional information and linking to datasets such as literature, environmental data, sequences and chemistry that will facilitate scientists to select organisms suitable for their research and enable innovative solutions to be developed. MIRRI will support researchers from academia and bio-industry offering a facilitated access to genetic resources via the envisioned MIRRI portal (a one-stop-shop for material, data and expertise), broader coverage of genetic resources (coordinated approach towards isolation and deposit of microorganisms), improved tailored service offer from mBRCs also coordinating smaller collections, interoperability of data (facilitated mining of trusted data), increase knowledge transfer to users and implementation of best practices for transition to a mBRC. MIRRI offers expert knowledge and user access in areas not provided by other ESFRI RIs and coordinates national mBRC networks to make best use of current capacity thus bridging gaps. It also contributes to the enhancement of the ERA by providing a single portal which acts as an umbrella structure for access to a large range of resources, data and expertise. By offering long-term deposition of raw material of high scientific and economic value for basic research and innovation in biotechnology, MIRRI will contribute to the H2020 societal challenge to improve health, food security, agriculture, forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research and to address aspects of clean and efficient energy.', 'MIRRI was included in the ESFRI Roadmap 2010.

The first telescope for studying zodiacal light, light dispersed by interplanetary material, entered service here in 1964. Its geographical location (between the eastern and western solar observatories), together with the clarity and excellent quality of the sky, mean that the Observatorio del Teide is ideally suited for studying the sun. For this reason it is home to Europe\'s finest solar telescopes. The Observatorio del Teide Residence, which has been in operation since January 1990, is a suite of facilities (including day and night-time dormitories, a kitchen and dining room, reception, living and games rooms, garages, a transformer station, power generator and solar panel park), which is available for use by scientific and technical staff linked to the Observatory. The Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias organises visits to the Observatory for colleges and groups as part of a public education campaign designed to make knowledge about astronomy accessible to everyone. The Observatorio del Teide has a Visitor Centre housed in an empty dome, which has been equipped to teach visitors about science. The centre has a capacity of around forty people and is used to explain what an observatory is, how telescopes work and the importance of Astronomy for the human race. Following the International Agreement on Cooperation in Astrophysics (1979), more than 60 research institutions from almost 20 countries have installed their telescopes and instruments for astrophysical research at the Canary Islands\' Observatories (Teide Observatory and Roque de los Muchachos Observatory). The following telescopes are accesible at Teide Observatory: Carlos Sánchez Telescope (TCS), IAC80 Telescope, Optical Ground Station (OGS), GREGOR, THEMIS, Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT), Solar Laboratory, Cosmic Microwave Background Experiments, Bradford Robotic Telescopes, Stella Robotic Telescopes, Optical Telescope Array (OTA), XO telescopes, DIMMA, SHABAR, SONG, MONS, EarthShine, TAD and EAST.

The main advantage of continuous muon beams is the detection of individual muons by fast-timing scintillation counters, easily providing nanosecond or better time resolution of the muon response. This allows one to extend μSR studies to much higher muon-spin precession frequencies (in the GHz range, corresponding to magnetic fields of more than 10 Tesla) and shorter muon-spin relaxation times compared to pulsed muon sources, where the time resolution is limited by the muon pulse duration (typically 50 ns).
